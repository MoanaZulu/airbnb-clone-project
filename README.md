## Technology Stack
-Backend: Django, Django Rest Framework
-Database: Postgre SQL
-Querying: Graph QL
-Async Tasks: Celery
-Caching: Redis
-Deployment: Docker, CI/CD pipelines

## Purpose & Role
-Django: High-level Python web framework that handles backend logic, routing, and MVC architecture. Ideal for rapid development and clean design.
-Django Rest Framework: Extends Django to build RESTful APIs. It simplifies serialization, authentication, and API views‚Äîperfect for mobile or frontend integration.
-PostgreSQL: Robust relational database system. Stores structured data like user profiles, property listings, and bookings. Supports complex queries and transactions.
-GraphQL:	Query language for APIs. Allows clients to request exactly the data they need‚Äîgreat for optimizing frontend performance and reducing over-fetching.
-Celery: Handles asynchronous tasks like sending emails, processing bookings, or generating reports. Keeps your app responsive by offloading time-consuming jobs.
-Redis: In-memory data store used for caching. Speeds up repeated queries (like popular listings) and supports Celery task queues.
-Docker: Containerizes your app to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and deployment. Makes your project portable and scalable.
-CI/CD pipelines: Automates testing and deployment. Ensures that every code change is validated and deployed smoothly‚Äîboosting reliability and team productivity.

## Database Design
-User Management: User id, email, password.
A user can leave reviews for properties they‚Äôve booked.
-Property management: Price per night, location, owner id.
Properties can receive multiple reviews.
-Booking system: booking id, user id, property id.
Booking history informs user behavior analytics and availability logic.
-Payment Processing: payment id, booking id, payment method.
Payments are tied to bookings.
-Review system: review id, user id, property id.
Reviews are submitted by users for properties they‚Äôve booked.
-Data optimization: query logs, cache keys, search rankings.
Insights help personalize user experience and marketing strategies.

## main feature breakdown 
-API documentation
-user Authentication
-Property management
-Booking system
-Payment Processing
-Review system 
-Database optimization

API documentation: It boosts collaboration, simplifies integration with frontend or mobile apps, and makes your project scalable for future enhancements.
user Authentication: It secures user data, sensitive actins like bookings, payments, and reviews.
Property management: It forms the backbone of the platform‚Äôs inventory and directly impacts search results and booking logic.
Booking system: Handles reservation workflows by linking users to properties with date and availability logic.
Review system: Enables users to leave feedback on properties they‚Äôve stayed in, fostering transparency and credibility.
Payment Processing: Securely manages transactions tied to bookings, including payment methods and receipts.
Database optimization: Improves performance by caching frequent queries, indexing key fields, and analyzing usage patterns.

## API security
-Open API (SWAGGER)
-GraphQL SDL
-R A M L
-API blueprint
-Postman collections
API are a form of gateway between frontend and backend, security is a need because without it, attackers could expoit endpoints to access user data. API makes it harder for attackers to access this data and only authoried requests are processed.

CI/CD pipeline
CI is the practice of automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository.
CD takes it a step further by automatically deploying those tested changes to a staging or production environment.
They matter because of 
-speed and efficiency
-consistency
-confidence
Pipelines are crucial because they automate and streamline the entire development lifecycle‚Äîfrom writing code to testing, deploying, and monitoring it.
-Github Actions
-Jekins
-Github CI/CD
-CircleCI
Travis CI
-Docker+ Docker compose
-Heroku pipelines
