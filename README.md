## üë• Team Roles
-Backend Developer: API design, business logic, and integration
-DB Admin: Schema design, optimization, and deployment
-DevOps Engineer: CI/CD setup, containerization, and deployment
-QA Engineer: Automated testing, bug tracking, and release validation

## Technology Stack
-Backend: Django, Django Rest Framework
-Database: Postgre SQL
-Querying: Graph QL
-Async Tasks: Celery
-Caching: Redis
-Deployment: Docker, CI/CD pipelines

## Purpose & Role
-Django: High-level Python web framework that handles backend logic, routing, and MVC architecture. Ideal for rapid development and clean design.
-Django Rest Framework: Extends Django to build RESTful APIs. It simplifies serialization, authentication, and API views‚Äîperfect for mobile or frontend integration.
-PostgreSQL: Robust relational database system. Stores structured data like user profiles, property listings, and bookings. Supports complex queries and transactions.
-GraphQL:	Query language for APIs. Allows clients to request exactly the data they need‚Äîgreat for optimizing frontend performance and reducing over-fetching.
-Celery: Handles asynchronous tasks like sending emails, processing bookings, or generating reports. Keeps your app responsive by offloading time-consuming jobs.
-Redis: In-memory data store used for caching. Speeds up repeated queries (like popular listings) and supports Celery task queues.
-Docker: Containerizes your app to ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and deployment. Makes your project portable and scalable.
-CI/CD pipelines: Automates testing and deployment. Ensures that every code change is validated and deployed smoothly‚Äîboosting reliability and team productivity.

## Database Design
-User Management: User id, email, password. Users can register, authenticate and leave reviews.
-Property management: Price per night, location, owner id. Hosts list properties with pricing, locaton, and availability.
-Booking system: booking id, user id, property id. Users reserve properties with date and user linkage
-Payment Processing: payment id, booking id, payment method. Secure transactions tied to bookings
-Review system: review id, user id, property id. Feedback submitted by verfied users
-Data optimization: query logs, cache keys, search rankings. Caching, query logs, and search rankings for performance

| **Review System**         | Allow users to leave feedback on booked properties              | Reviews tied to bookings; only verified users can post; moderation enabled                              | ‚úÖ Completed       |
| **Database Optimization** | Improve performance through indexing, caching, and query tuning  | Indexed fields; Redis caching active; slow queries logged and optimized                                | üîÑ In Progress     |

## API security
APIs act as the gateway between frontend and backend, and must be protected to prevent unauthorized access. This project uses..
-OpenAPI (Swagger): Interactive documentation and schema validation
-GraphQL SDL: Schema definition for secure query control
-RAML / API Blueprint: Optional formats for structured API design
-Postman Collections: For testing and sharing API workflows

##Security measures include:
-Token-based authentication
-Rate limiting and input validation
-Role-based access control
-HTTPS enforcement and CORS policies

## CI/CD pipelines
CI (Continuous Integration) is the practice of automatically testing and integrating code changes into a shared repository.
CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) takes it a step further by automatically deploying those tested changes to a staging or production environment.

## Benefits
-Speed and efficiency
-Consistency across environments
-Confidence in every release

## Tools used
-GitHub Actions
-Jenkins
-CircleCI
-Travis CI
-Docker + Docker Compose
-Heroku Pipelines
